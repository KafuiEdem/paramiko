"""
Challenge #6
A Network Engineer has created this Python script that executes show ip interface brief on a remote Cisco Router and displays the output.
Although the script connects and authenticates successfully, it doesnâ€™t display the entire output of the command, but only a part of it.
Your task is to troubleshoot the issue and solve it so that it displays the entire output.
